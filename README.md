# Fake_Real_News
It is a natural language processing model project to classify fake or real news in a text dataset using the "Passive Aggressive" classifier.
* 1.The data set is read and cleaned, stop-words are removed, and lemmatization is applied to normalize word roots. 
* 2.The data set is divided into training and test sets and the features of the texts are extracted using the TF-IDF vectorization method.
* 3.Next, the "Passive Aggressive" classifier is trained and the accuracy rate is calculated using the test data.
* 4.It takes the text that the user has entered, applies the same preprocessing steps, and uses the classifier to guess whether the text is fake or real.
